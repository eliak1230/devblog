## Navigating My Game Development Journey

> ### Stage 2 – From Ideas to Concrete Plans

Welcome back to our game development journey!

In our last post, we delved into the exciting stage of sharing ideas for our upcoming game. Today, we're taking the next big leap and moving forward to the second stage of development – where we discuss intricate details such as rules, turn-offs, and other game elements. Let's dive in and explore how our game is taking shape!

### Discussing the Game Details

With the basic premise of the game, involving flipping cards and matching the answer board, already in place, it's time to work out the nitty-gritty details that will make our game truly stand out.

### Crafting the Game Design Document

At the onset of this stage, each team member took charge of developing a comprehensive Game Design Document. This document served as a blueprint for our newly creating game, capturing all the essential elements that would define the player's experience. We used **"Excalidraw"** which served as an easy tool to express our thoughts.

Some of the key sections that we covered were:

1. **How to Win?** Defining the goals and objectives that players must achieve to claim victory.

2. **How to Lose?** Outlining the conditions that lead to failure or game over. Sometimes, there is no losing.

3. **How to Chang Difficulty Levels?** Designing mechanisms to adjust the game's challenge as players progress.

4. **Exploring Variations:** Considering different game variations to keep the experience fresh and exciting.

### Bringing Ideas to Life

Translating thoughts and concepts into a visual form is essential, as words alone might not do justice to the gameplay experience. We engaged in brainstorming sessions and sketching out various gameplay scenarios. This process allowed us to visualize how players would interact with the game mechanics and how each element would contribute to the overall fun and engagement.

> This shows games in various difficulty levels. Images on the left show stages involving multiple flips, and one image on the right shows fixed cards.

Furthermore, during the visualization phase, I encountered some ideas that proved challenging to convey clearly in a visual format.

- EX: Colour cards were hard for me to visualize, and I thought this aspect will complicate people.

As a result, I carefully eliminate these ideas. It's all about ensuring that every aspect of the game is intuitive and easy to understand for our target audience.

### Final Results

As we progress through the second stage of game development, the intricate details of our game are taking shape.
