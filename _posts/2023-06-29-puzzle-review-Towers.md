## Towers

Welcome to my first puzzle review post!

In today's post, I'll be sharing my thoughts on a fascinating puzzle called "Towers" from [Simon Tatham’s Portable Puzzle Collection](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/).

### To Start

#### What is the puzzle "Towers"?

Also known as "skyscraper," Towers is a logic puzzle that offers simple rules and challenging solutions.

#### Why is it beneficial?

Playing Towers can have several benefits for your brain:

- Requiring you to analyze the puzzle grid and make deductions based on the given clues enhances your `logical reasoning`.
- As you need to keep track of the numbers you've already placed and the possibilities for each cell, the puzzle tests your `memory skills`.
- By asking you to picture the heights of the towers in relation to the given clues and grid layout, it challenges your `spatial perception`.

### Guide

The rules are simple and similar to Sudoku.

The goal is to place towers in all cells on the grid according to the rules:

1. Fill in the grid with towers whose heights range from 1 to the grid size. For example, the puzzle in the image has towers from 1 to 5 for a 5x5 puzzle.

2. Every possible height must appear exactly once in each row and column. If this rule is violated, you will see the numbers turning red.

3. Each clue around the edge counts the number of towers that are visible when looking into the grid from that direction. This means taller towers hide shorter ones behind them.

4. To place a tower, click in a square to select it, then type the desired height on the keyboard (in this case, from 1 to 5).
5. To erase a tower, click to select a square and then press Backspace.
6. Right-click in a square and then type a number to add or remove the number, indicating tower heights that you think *might* go in that square.

7. Finally, left-click on a clue to mark it as done (grey it out). To unmark a clue as done, left-click on it again.

### Tip

Start with clues that say "1" or "5", as "clue 1" means tallest tower (Tower 5) is blocking the others and "clue 5" means towers 1 to 5 are in ascending order.

> Start with clue 5 example above

### Personal Opinion

Among the wide variety of puzzles, "Towers" is undoubtedly one of my favorites.

Towers not only stimulates logical thinking and memory skills but also challenges the depth of spatial perception. Moreover, the ability to visualize the heights of the towers based on the given clues is a unique and satisfying aspect of this puzzle.

I chose to review "Towers" as my first puzzle because it holds several differences between physical version and digital version:

- It allows for `easier corrections` if mistakes are made while placing towers.
- `Marking` multiple possible towers as options becomes more convenient on a digital platform (right-clicking and typing a possible number function)
- The online version offers `flexibility` in choosing the difficulty level and the grid sizes ranging from 3 to 9.

#### Suggestions

- To make the game more engaging, it would be beneficial to implement a continuous difficulty progression.
  - Currently, Towers offers fixed difficulty levels (such as 4x4, 5x5, etc.)
  - By introducing this new system, the game would become more dynamic and rewarding, where players can constantly face new challenges that push their limits and allow for continuous skill improvement.
- Introducing more variety to each level of the Towers puzzle, such as diverse shapes and varying numbers of revealed clues and towers, can add excitement and keep players motivated.
  - This way, players would be motivated to tackle difficult levels while enjoying new shapes, clue distributions, and tower revelations.

If you're looking to challenge your brain with a variety of puzzles, I highly recommend exploring the "Towers"!
