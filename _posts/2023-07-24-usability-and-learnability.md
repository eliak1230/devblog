## Unraveling the Mysteries of Game Design

> ### Usability vs. Learnability

Today, we're diving into the world of game designing and exploring two crucial aspects that can help our gaming experience: **usability and learnability**.

### Usability - The Path to Seamless Interaction

Usability in game design refers to how easily players can interact with and navigate through the game. It's all about providing a smooth and intuitive experience that minimizes confusion and maximizes enjoyment.

A game with excellent usability ensures that players can effortlessly perform actions, access features, and understand game mechanics.

Here are some essential aspects of usability in game design:

- **Clear User Interface (UI):** A well-designed UI presents information in a clear and organized manner, making it easy for players to understand their objectives, progress, and available options.

- **Intuitive Controls:** The game should have controls that feel natural and responsive, allowing players to easily execute actions without frustration.

- **Consistency:** Consistency in design elements, such as button placement and visual cues, fosters familiarity and reduces the learning curve for players.

- **Accessibility:** Ensuring that the game is accessible to players of all abilities (especially our target audience!) is crucial for a broader audience reach.

- **Good Error Handling:** A user-friendly game anticipates potential mistakes and provides easy ways for players to rectify them without significant consequences.

### Learnability - The Gateway to Engaging Experiences

Learnability in game design revolves around how quickly and effectively players can grasp the game's mechanics and rules. It's the foundation for creating a positive onboarding experience, ensuring that players feel engaged and motivated to continue playing.

Here are the key elements of learnability in game design:

- **Clear Tutorials:** Well-designed tutorials introduce players to the game's core concepts and mechanics gradually, allowing them to learn by doing.

- **Progressive Challenges:** As players progress through the game, it's essential to gradually increase the difficulty level to keep them engaged and motivated to improve their skills.

- **Contextual Help:** In-game hints or contextual prompts can guide players when they encounter new or complex situations, preventing frustration and enhancing the learning process.

- **Feedback:** Providing timely feedback and rewards for achievements encourages players to learn from their experiences and continue their journey.

### Finding the Perfect Balance

Now, we all know the difference between usability and learnability. *However*, to create an unforgettable gaming experience, we have to ask another question.

***How do we find a balance between usability and learnability?***

The answer is simple.

#### Know Your Audience

Understanding our players is the first step. Are you designing a casual game for beginners or a complex RPG for hardcore gamers? Tailoring your approach to match your target audience's experience level is crucial. For example, since our players are older people, if the game is too challenging, players may feel overwhelmed. Striking the right chord with your audience is the secret to success!

#### Start with the Basics

When designing the game, begin with a strong foundation of usability. Nail the intuitive controls, create a clean and organized UI, and ensure a seamless experience from the get-go. I believe this establishes a user-friendly environment that players can easily navigate (This is especially important for our target audience!). After all, no one likes getting lost in confusing menus!

#### Consider Feedbacks

Observe how players interact with your game and take note of their experiences. Moreover, analyze their feedback and be open to making necessary adjustments. During our rule developing process, our team left a room for adjustments. After we launch the game and collect enough data, we can further improve the game.

For example, when data show that having limited # moves is too difficult, we can adjust the difficulty level of the game.

Continuous iteration is the key to refining the balance between usability and learnability.

### Moving On

Now that we've unlocked the secrets of usability and learnability, it's time to move on!

In my next post, I will discuss about designing process.

Remember, creating an epic gaming experience is all about making it easy to play and fun to learn.
