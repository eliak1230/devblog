## Navigating My Game Development Journey

> ### Stage 3 – Designing Process

Welcome back!

In our previous post, we discussed the exciting process of brainstorming rules and ideas for our puzzle.

Now, we're diving into another crucial aspect of game development – creating the perfect game design!

Today's post is divided into two different sections: creating the game icon and planning the actual game screen design.

>### Designing the Perfect Puzzle Icon

As people say, first impressions matter, and our puzzle icon is the gateway to capturing users' attention. Let's explore the significance of a well-designed and memorable icon and the essential roles it plays in the digital realm.

#### The Face of Your Game

Think of the game icon as the friendly face of your puzzle, greeting potential users. It's the first visual element that catches their eye, so nailing the design is essential. An eye-catching and unique icon can be the key to attracting curious users and encouraging them to explore further.

#### Reflecting Your Game's Personality

Just like the Golden Brain puzzles have their own personality, our new icon should reflect the app's essence. Furthermore, consistency in design across the Golden Brain puzzle icons fosters brand recognition and helps establish a strong presence in users' minds.

For example, our team used the theme colours of the Golden Brain while developing our own icon designs. This helps with the overall consistancy of our game.

#### Instant Recognition

A well-designed icon should work like a mental post-it note for users. It helps people recognize the game at a glance. In all of our designing ideas, our team tried to make icons that describe the game easily.

For example, since our new game involves flipping cards, all of our samples include cards.

#### Simplicity is Key

When it comes to icons, simplicity is the key. An icon crammed with details can become confusing or difficult to identify on smaller screens. Therefore, it is best to embrace minimalism and focus on a clean and straightforward design that conveys the core essence of the puzzle.

#### Sharing Our Icon Ideas

I beleive each ideas are unique in their own ways. Also, I really liked the Sample #3's game name.

> ### Screen Design

Next is all about game screen designing – a pivotal aspect of creating a user-centric digital experience.

At the heart of every great screen design lies a deep understanding of user needs and preferences. *What are your users looking for? What tasks do they want to accomplish?*

For our target audience, here is a list of several factors of consideration:

1. **Embracing User Interface (UI) Design:** It involves choosing the right colors, fonts, icons, and layout to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

2. **Prioritizing User Experience (UX):** UX designers focus on usability, accessibility, and interaction flow, ensuring that users achieve their goals effortlessly.

3. **Simplicity and Clarity:** I think this is one of the most important concept to consider when designing. Avoid overwhelming users with too much information or unnecessary complexity. Keep screens clean, clear, and clutter-free, guiding users to their desired destinations with ease. For example, I've learned that developers don't usually put two icons or items on the same row to avoid clusture and confusion.

4. **Consistency and Navigation:** Keep elements like buttons, icons, and navigation consistent across screens to provide a familiar and intuitive experience. Smooth and straightforward navigation ensures users never get lost and can explore the digital world effortlessly.

#### Practice, Practice, and More Practice

Our team practiced designing through re-creating a page of **"The World's Best Puzzle Contest"**.

I was responsible for re-designing the special matching game event ("천하제일대회").

> Re-created Version. I worked hard to expand the overall page size and the game image for the users.

#### Final Product

This is our new game "playing" page. After learning basics for material designing and practicing, our team gathered our ideas!

> Our theme colours are adapted. We decided to have maximum of 6 by 6 puzzle after closely considering the margin's safety areas.
