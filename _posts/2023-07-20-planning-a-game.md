## Navigating My Game Development Journey

> ### Stage 1 â€“ Brainstorming Ideas

This post is about what I experienced throughout my task of collaborating with others to create a new puzzle.

Game development is no easy task, especially if you want to create a game that captivates and delights users.

**Understanding the targetted audience and their preferences** is crucial. Therefore, while brainstorming puzzle ideas, I had to consider the demographic of the targets (age, gender, characteristics, etc.)

> While planning the Golden Brain game out, I came to the understanding that our target audience is older women who wants to exercise their minds. Ultimately, the goal is to create a game that doesn't feel like a traditional "game" but still provided an enjoyable and brain-stimulating exercise that prevents and warns Alzheimer's.

With our audience in mind, we brainstormed numerous exciting ideas for the Golden Brain puzzle game. Join me as I delve into the exciting world of game planning for our puzzle!

### Counting Triangles

This puzzle idea is presented by one of my team member. To play this game, users would need to count the total number of triangles in a given figure. This puzzle aimed to boost users' creativity and mathematical skills.

I think the puzzle itself is very intriguing and possible for variability as developers can bring countless shapes. *However, this game is challenging to create, as developer must design every puzzle stages. Plus, the game itself might be too difficult to complete by the target audience.*

### 9x9 Mathematical Sudoku

This puzzle idea is presented by one of my team member. To play this game, similar to the classic Sudoku, users would fill a 9x9 grid with numbers based on provided hints.

Just like **Counting Triangles** our team agrees that, although interesting, *this puzzle can be too difficult for our target audience.*

### Cards Turning Game

This puzzle idea is presented by one of my team member. To play this game, users would be presented with 30 cards (flipped facing down) each containing a pair and tasked with matching the pair. This puzzle aimed to improve users' memorization.

Our team comes into a conclusion that this game is easy to code and suited for our target audience. *However, in Golden Brain, similar game is in the stage of development. Therefore, it is better for us to add more unique elements.*

### Word Scramble

This puzzle idea is presented by me and the objective of this word jumble challenge is to provide an straightforward, engaging, and enjoyable puzzle. The goal is to rearrange a set of jumbled letters to form a meaningful word. Words can be chosen at a wordbank that is familiar to the targeted consumers.

To make the game more engaging, I thought it would be beneficial to implement a **continuous difficulty progression**, such as having **longer words** per round and making players to click the matching set of letters in **order**.

*However, this game still requires the developers to provide a wordbank. Moreover, this game still involves the concept of matching cards which is an element that already exists.*

> ### Final Product

Since most of our ideas involved some form of flipping cards, our outcome also involves cards turning. However, in this new game, players flip a card, all cards surrounding the clicked card also flip. Also, there is Answer Board and Problem Board for matching.
